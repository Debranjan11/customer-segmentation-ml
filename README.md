📊 Customer Segmentation System

Using Rule-Based and Machine Learning Approaches

Final Year Project – Semester 7

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Customer Segmentation System that groups customers into meaningful segments using both:

Rule-Based Segmentation (feature engineering & business logic)

Machine Learning–Based Segmentation (K-Means clustering)

The system is designed with a clean, modular architecture, where:

Streamlit is used only for the user interface

All preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML logic are handled in backend modules

File-based storage is used to keep the system simple and extensible

This approach ensures clarity, interpretability, and future scalability, making the project suitable for academic evaluation and real-world extension.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze customer data and identify meaningful customer segments

To implement explainable rule-based segmentation

To apply unsupervised machine learning (K-Means) for data-driven clustering

To visualize customer clusters using PCA

To build an interactive UI for analysis and result exploration

To maintain a modular architecture for future upgrades (DB, APIs, Cloud)

🧠 Segmentation Approaches Used
1️⃣ Rule-Based Segmentation

Uses predefined business rules

Based on Annual Income and Spending Score

Produces interpretable segments:

High Value Customers

Medium Value Customers

Low Value Customers

2️⃣ Machine Learning–Based Segmentation

Uses K-Means clustering

Unsupervised learning (no labels required)

Discovers hidden patterns in customer behavior

Cluster count (K) selectable via UI

📊 Visualization Techniques

Bar Chart: Shows distribution of customers across segments

PCA Scatter Plot:

Reduces high-dimensional data to 2D

Used only for visualization

Helps understand cluster separation visually

Clustering is performed on original scaled features; PCA is not used for training.

🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

UI Layer
Streamlit-based interface for file upload, configuration, and visualization

Controller Layer
Orchestrates preprocessing, segmentation, and result aggregation

Service Layer

Preprocessing

Feature engineering

ML training & prediction

PCA transformation

Storage Layer

CSV files for uploaded data

Pickle files for trained ML models

This separation ensures low coupling and high maintainability.
